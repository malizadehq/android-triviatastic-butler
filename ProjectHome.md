A SFSU student project.

Triviatastic is a fun, easy to use application that will focus on delivering a great trivia experience to the android platform.

Players will test their knowledge within a series of unique trivia categories. By answering questions correctly, players will earn coins which they can spend to unlock new, more challenging trivia games. If the player needs a life-line, they can elect to spend coins for a bailout (at an expense!). Triviatastic seeks to keep players engaged with satisfying results for correctly answered questions, and setting goals for players to work towards.
